# Proxy IoT device module

This module can be used to create proxy objects representing IoT devices
and POST measurement data from them to IoT Service via a Cloud REST gateway.
It uses Promises/async functions, which come handy in high-volume data transfers
typical for Cloud-to-Cloud interaction.

The module can be installed with `npm install <module folder>`.
